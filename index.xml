      <description>Johnny is a Software Developer and a Structural Engineer.
I began passionately coding after being introduced to it by my Brother-in-law. He was hosting a capture the flag event called Armyctf for his students and he extended the invitation my way.

The course took me several months to complete, much longer than the long weekend that the students attempted to complete it in.</description>
