                <p>Software Developer and a Structural Engineer.</p>
<p>I began passionately coding after being introduced to it by my brother-in-law.  He was hosting a capture the flag event called Armyctf for his students and he extended the invitation my way. The puzzles, primarily run through the command line and scripts hooked me.  The course took me several months to complete, much longer than the long weekend that the students attempted to complete it in.  The logical structure of solutions to complex problems grabbed my interest the same way buildings had years prior, the pleasure of finding things out, as Feynman described it.</p>
<p>Cyber challenges continued to enamor me as I dug deeper into course work.  &ldquo;Hacking, The Art of Exploitation&rsquo;', Tryhackme.com, hackthebox.eu, &ldquo;Automate The Boring Stuff, &ldquo;Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures Using Python&rsquo;',  &ldquo;Python 3 Object Oriented Programming&rdquo;, &ldquo;Java Programming by Mooc.fi&rsquo;', SQLZOO, &ldquo;Hand-on Machine Learning with Scikit and Tensorflow&rdquo;.  As the challenges grew so did my supplemental learning to keep up with them.</p>
<p>As I began to feel competent and confident in my understanding of the materials I began to socialize in the cyber community, I attended several lectures hosted at the Google office, and other events around New York City.  There were many self learners, like myself, and though it may not feel inviting from some comments on Stack Exchange, the community was open and inviting, as most engineering fields are as well.  I looked at how to make a career shift into cyber.</p>
<p>I have worked in structural engineering for about ten years.  I am a registered PE in the state of New York.  My first job in the field was for Turner Construction where I learned project management.  From there I moved to Maxwell Structural Design Studio where I learned structural design.  I currently work at CCA, Construction Consulting Associates, where I&rsquo;ve continued to learn about structural design and theory.  At CCA we consult on forensic challenges.  This means that following a building or building component failure, natural disaster, or industrial disaster we find the root of the failure, and determine how to fix it.  It has taught me to be patient and how to build research based conclusions to problems.</p>
<p>Several friends helped come to the conclusion that although the cyber field interested me, software could be a more beneficial direction.  I have a good deal of experience in structural design, forensics, and construction, leaving that all to follow would be unreasonable.  With that, I set off on my current direction.</p>
<p>I am aspiring to design and research Software and Data Science for the world of Civil/Structural Engineering, construction, and the built environment.</p>
