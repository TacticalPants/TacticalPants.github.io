      <description>Following an oil plant explosion in Port Neches, Texas we were hired to determine the structural safety of the plant for rescue teams and fire fighters to enter. Following the stabilization of the plant we investigated the soundness of all the houses and buildings in the surrounding area. The blast radius was several miles in diameter so the project encompassed investigating thousands of structures.</description>

      <description>I performed a structural, site and facility assessment, and in conjunction with another firm determined what upgrades were necessary for the site to maintain operation with a potentially rising sea level and more frequent damaging hurricanes in the New York Harbor.</description>

      <description>I founded and developed the drone building inspection program at CCA. The program acquired projects that required the inspection of the façade and roof condition of buildings in select projects in: New York, NY, Jersey City, NJ, Boston, MA, Worcester, MA, and Houston, TX. This photo was taken at an investigation of the Dixon MIlls Condominiums. The building used to operate as the Dixon Mills-Ticonderoga pencil manufacturing plant.</description>

      <description>This was a passion project for our engineering firm. We designed several log cabins during my time with Maxwell SDS but this one was unique in that it was roughly 15 miles away from the nearest road. There were no electrical services or running water at the plot. Although the county that the cabin was built in we designed it to the ASCE 7-16 witch includes a large snowload due the elevation and location in the mountains.</description>

      <description>I served as the lead structural engineer for seven, high-end, four-story condominium buildings in Sun Valley, Idaho. This project required the design of all framing systems and custom components and included concrete retaining foundations, steel column and beam structures, and wood timber framing. The substantial snow load and earthquake load incurred in this region of Idaho proved to make designing a structure with many window surfaces a unique challenge.</description>

      <description>This is a high end residential building in Ketchum, Idaho that I feel is indicative of the typical design and construction type that I worked on while living in Idaho.</description>

      <description>My first job after graduating from college was at the WTC Tower Two reconstruction run by Turner Construction. When I arrived we were bringing debris out of the existing foundation and excavating to the bedrock. From there we construct the building&amp;rsquo;s foundation system up to grade, its approximately 100 feet from bedrock to street level. I served as a project manager or PM and worked as a member of a team overseeing all aspects of the building’s construction.</description>
